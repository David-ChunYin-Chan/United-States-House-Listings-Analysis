# United States House Listings Analysis

## Introduction
The year 2023 has been marked by economic instability, characterized by high inflation and interest rates, significantly impacting daily life. Given that housing constitutes the largest portion of household expenses, it is evident that these economic factors would exert a substantial influence on the housing market. As we approach the end of 2023, it is opportune to conduct a comprehensive overview of the US housing market, leveraging data from Zillow, a prominent online real estate marketplace that encompasses information on approximately 100 million homes. <br>

This project aims to visualize and conduct a high-level analysis of the US housing market using a dataset comprising around 25,000 listings sourced from Zillow. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of housing characteristics across different states. The initial phase involves data cleaning using Pandas in Python, followed by visualization of the dataset using Power BI. This dual approach allows for a robust examination of trends and patterns within the housing market, providing insights into the potential impact of economic conditions on the real estate landscape.
