    "The year 2023 has been marked by economic instability, characterized by high inflation and interest rates, significantly impacting daily life. Given that housing constitutes the largest portion of household expenses, it is evident that these economic factors would exert a substantial influence on the housing market. As we approach the end of 2023, it is opportune to conduct a comprehensive overview of the US housing market, leveraging data from Zillow, a prominent online real estate marketplace that encompasses information on approximately 100 million homes. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to visualize and conduct a high-level analysis of the US housing market using a dataset comprising around 25,000 listings sourced from Zillow. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of housing characteristics across different states. The initial phase involves data cleaning using Pandas in Python, followed by visualization of the dataset using Power BI. This dual approach allows for a robust examination of trends and patterns within the housing market, providing insights into the potential impact of economic conditions on the real estate landscape."

However, it is strongly recommended to use the \"Median\" metric, as it provides a more accurate reflection of central tendency for right-skewed data. The \"Average\" metric may be influenced by extreme values. <br> <br>\n",
    "Under the \"Average\" mode, the overall average house price for the U.S. increases to \\\\$532,000. Montana and Nevada join California as the top three states with the highest average prices, while the top three most affordable states remain unchanged."

    "Upon exploration of the dashboard, several key insights on U.S. housing prices in 2023 have emerged from the data: <br>\n",
    "- The significant difference between the average and median prices suggests a right-skewed distribution in U.S. housing prices. This is common in real estate markets where luxury properties can significantly drive up the average price. <br> <br>\n",
    "- There is a trend of higher housing prices on the west coast, followed by the east coast, while the central part of the country tends to offer more affordable housing options. The higher prices may be attributed to factors like booming tech industries, urbanization, and desirable living conditions. <br> <br>\n",
    "- Contrary to expectations, New York, despite being a globally renowned business center, does not boast the highest housing prices compared to other U.S. states. The observation may stem from the fact that New York accommodates a broad range of housing options, not solely consisting of high-end properties. Additionally, factors like neighborhood characteristics and accessibility can contribute to varied housing prices within the state. <br> <br>\n",
    "- Colorado, situated in the central part of the U.S., exhibits relatively higher housing prices compared to states with a similar geographical location. This could be influenced by its appeal as a destination with a strong economy, outdoor recreational opportunities, and an overall high quality of life. Factors such as population growth, limited housing supply, and increased demand for desirable locations within the state may contribute to the higher prices."

    "\n",
    "- Intra-State Visualization and Analysis: Extend the analysis to include intra-state visualization and examination. This would involve exploring the housing market dynamics across various cities within a state, providing a more detailed perspective on regional variations and trends. <br><br>\n",
    "- Time-Series Analysis with Across-Year Data: Incorporate across-year data to perform time-series analysis. This approach allows for the identification of long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and potential cyclicality in housing prices. Examining changes over time can offer valuable insights into the market's evolution. <br><br>\n",
    "- Automated Web Scraping for Data Verification: Develop an automated web-scraping system to verify and correct missing or inaccurate values in the dataset. This proactive approach ensures data accuracy and maintains the dataset's reliability, contributing to more robust analyses. <br><br>\n",
    "- Price Prediction Model: Consider developing a price prediction model to forecast house prices based on given features. Machine learning models, such as regression algorithms, can be trained on historical data to predict future housing prices. This predictive model would be a valuable tool for both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions."
